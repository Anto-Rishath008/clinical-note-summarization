# Artifacts Directory

This directory contains **generated artifacts** that are **NOT committed to version control**.

## Contents (Gitignored)

### `checkpoints/`
Model checkpoints saved during training:
- `best_model.pt` - Best model by validation ROUGE-L
- `last_model.pt` - Most recent checkpoint
- `checkpoint_step_*.pt` - Periodic checkpoints
- `metadata.json` - Training metadata

**Note:** Model files are typically 350+ MB each and are excluded via `.gitignore`.

### `logs/`
Training logs and metrics:
- TensorBoard event files
- Training/validation loss curves
- Console output logs

### `hf_runs/`
HuggingFace Trainer artifacts:
- Trainer state files
- Optimizer states
- Scheduler states

### `predictions/`
Model predictions during evaluation:
- Generated summaries
- Comparison tables
- Error analysis

### `tokenizer/`
Trained tokenizer models:
- `spm.model` - SentencePiece model file
- `spm.vocab` - Vocabulary file

## Reproducing Artifacts

All artifacts can be regenerated by running:

```powershell
# Train model (generates checkpoints)
python train.py --config configs/default.yaml

# Evaluate (generates predictions)
python evaluate.py --checkpoint artifacts/checkpoints/best_model.pt

# Train tokenizer (if needed)
python scripts/train_tokenizer.py
```

## Storage Requirements

Typical artifact sizes:
- Full training: ~10-15 GB
- Minimal (best checkpoint only): ~400 MB
- Logs: ~100-500 MB

## Cleanup

To remove all artifacts:
```powershell
.\scripts\clean_repo.ps1
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Never commit model weights, checkpoints, or large data files to Git. These are automatically excluded by `.gitignore`.
