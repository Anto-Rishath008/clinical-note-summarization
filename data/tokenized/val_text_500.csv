As her transaminitis peaked, care is supportive, and she and her family are reliable, she was discharged home with close followup without antibiotics or changes to immune-suppressing medications. ACUTE MEDICAL ISSUES: #Infectious Mononucleosis due to EBV: Patient remained in hospital for workup of fever in an immunocomprimised patient, as well as transamnitis. She initially had diffuse symptoms including joint pain, epigastric pain, headache, and cough. Her labs showed LFT abnormalities but RUQ US showed only nonspecific inflammation, thus there was no clear localizing lab result.

Eventually, her symptoms became more localized to the upper respiratory tract with lymphadenopathy and tonsillar exudates (negative for strep). On day of discharge, EBV viral load returned positive despite negative IgG and IgM antibiodies and despite negative Monospot. She was discharged with instructions to avoid contact sports, to return if LUQ pain, and to continue supportive care. # Transaminitis: Likely due to EBV viremia. Alternative was considered that doxycycline (which she had been taking in week prior to admission) provoked acute cholestatic liver injury, which is a rare side effect.

Multiple dermatomal involvement qualifies as disseminated zoster. In addition, patient has parathesias on L inner thigh suggestive of zoster crossing midline, which is also a criterion for disseminated zoster, although there are no vesicles present and may not appear now that patient is being treated. He has no lab abnormalities to suggest hepatic involvement. Creatinine mildly elevated, but this may be related to dehydration in setting of acute infection. As mentioned, he has possible involvment of R pinna, suggesting ___, which is concerning for progression to herpes ophthalmicus. Patient did endorse some R eye pain this AM, but difficult to decipher the pain/headache he has from the other lesions and specific eye pain. Patient denies changes in vision. No neck stiffness and he has no meningismus on exam so herpez meningitis unlikely. Patient was started on IV acyclovir 10mg/kg for 7 days. Ophthomology was consulted for possible eye involvement given symptoms of eye pain and lesions on pinna - per ophtho, patient cleared by them for unlikely eye involvement with instruction to call them if patient developed lights, floaters, changes in vision and will follow up with ophtho as outpatient. ID was consutled given disease progression and the fact that acyclovir was started as an outpatient (with reported compliance). Per Dr. ___ saw patient as outpatient directly prior to admission and started him on acyclovir as outpatient, his clinical picture appears to be the same. For that reason, the patient was kept on IV acyclovir regimen. On day of discharge, patient was transitioned to PO valacyclovir with improvement in lesions and no new lesions."

He is now transferred from outpatient ___ at the requests of Drs. ___ ___ who are requesting further inpatient workup and treatment of his encephalopathy. History is provided by patient and his sister who accompanies him to the ED, also from ___ electronic records. At baseline, he is a high-functioning individual, a retired ___ who lives alone and performs all his AADLs independently. On ___, he was found at home by his cleaning person: confused, oriented only to self, and aphasic with word-finding difficulty. He was naked, with stool and possible blood seen throughout the house. He had last spoken with his sister one week and five days earlier (on the phone) who did not not any problems, so timing and chronicity of the event was not clear. He was BIBA to ___ for further evaluation. In the ___ emergency department, vitals were 98.0, 147/72, 68, 20, 98% RA, FSBS 68. He was noted to have knee bruising bilaterally. NCHCT was unrevealing. He was unable to give an initial history so it was provided by a friend. ___ was consulted to guide his inpatient workup and treatment. Their initial exam was notable for a transcortical global amnesia: multiple neologisms, phonemic and semantic paraphasias, and decreased comprehsnsion to simple and complex commands, and impaired naming. Per the initial Neurology note: He is unable to describe anything meaningful although he keeps saying that feels being in a dream-like state, has had some kind of visions, with faces appearing and disappearing and he is using complexed words to describe the symptoms. He denies any clearcut headache. The following day, his family states he was talking about nonsensical things like being beaten up by a gang of men. He underwent two MRI brains (with/without contast) which were inconclusive (except for diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement as it had been performed following LP). LP showed normal cell profile: prot 46, glu 114, RBC 84, WBC 2. CSF HSV PCR, RPR and Lyme were all negative, CSF ___ is pending on discharge. EEG showed mild L>R slowing over two days. Psychiatry consult was obtained, and they felt that his symptoms were more attributable to delirium than a psychiatric condition. He was thus started on Valproate for encephalopathy vs. delirium vs. structural process without seizure activity. His mental status very gradually improved while at ___ but he ultimately required discharge to assisted living facility ___ at ___. Currently, patient and his family acknowledge that he is continuing to very slowly improve from the initial insult, but he remains far from baseline. Patient notices that he is very easily distracted and slow to process information: for example, when he visited his house today he couldn't find any of his passcodes and was having difficulty figuring out how to pay his ___ ___. When he got into the passenger seat of his sister's car, he kept on using the incorrect door handle to close the door. His sister also notes that he is still having word finding difficulties in that it takes him a long time to come around to reach the word he was intending to use (circumlocution). He has significant trouble remembering names or people and places. He stutters at baseline, and notes that this is back to normal for him. Today Mr. ___ saw Drs. ___ in outpatient clinic for follow-up. They felt that his encephalopathy had been incompletely worked up and sent him to the ED for admission and definitive workup and treatment of his symptoms. Specifically, they are interested in looking for Hashimoto encephalopathy, paraneoplastic etiologies, or Creutzfeld-Jakob. I had a superficial discussion about depression and mood disorders with the patient and he denied any significant issues. However, of note, in the ED he had a routine depression screening performed by one of the nurses. ___ am told that he told them he has thought about suicide but would not consider doing it. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> - HTN - HLD - IDDM (with h/o multiple hyploglycemic prior episodes secondary to self-injecting insulin, inculding an episode of encephalopathy in ___ - Depression <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> No","The patient is a ___ year old man w PMH HTN, HLD, IDDM c/b multiple hypoglycemic episodes (including one in ___ in which he was reportedly encephalopathic), who presented to ___ ___ on ___ after being found confused, wandering, naked and covered in feces and noted to have a transcortical global aphasia vs acute confusional state. He completed an extensive workup for altered mental status including two MRIs, an LP and two EEGs, yet the etiology of this episode remained unclear. He was started on depakote at ___ although his EEG did not show any epileptiform discharges, although they did have some L temporal slowing. He was seen by his outpatient Neurology who was concerned that the patient was not yet back to his baseline (a high functioning mathematecian). Original plan was to get an LP to look for ___. However, during admission, the patient looked well, and was doing crossword puzzles and sudoku. There was no aphasia or other focal neurological findings. He had some mild word finding difficulty, but overall seemed to be improving with time. CJD would not be expected to gradually improve in this fashion, so we deferred LP (since other relevant studies had already been sent). We did she thyroid panel for further eval. Overall his picture is most consistent with a severe acute confusional state, possibly ___ hypoglycemia (the patient has a history of hypoglycemia and has only been on oral anti-diabetic medications until late ___, when he was switched back to insulin injections shortly before the incident described). Seizure less likely given no epileptiform discharges on EEG or focal findings on MRI, and no report of seizure activity. Thus we started a depakote taper with plan to DC depakote. This may also help with the patient's mental status, as depakote can cause mental slowing. We reassessed the patients mood upon admission. While he says he does have some"

A nicardipine drip was started to maintain sBP<140. Mannitol 75g IV was also bolused due to concern for herniation. FFP and K-centra were given to correct INR. A repeat NCHCT was performed at 0030 showing apparent interval increase in the size of Mr. ___ hemorrhage causing increasing midline shift with concern for subfalcine herniation and entrapment of the horns of lateral ventricle. Neurosurgery was also consulted for possible surgical managment. After discussion with attending on service, who reviewed the relevant images, surgical intervention was felt to be futile due to the extent of Mr. ___ injury. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - HTN - HLD - mitral valve repair (___) - aortic valve replacement (___) <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> NC <PHYSICAL EXAM> Admission Exam: VS afebrile HR65 BP143/87 Sat100vent GEN - intubated, no spontaneous movements observed HEENT - NC/AT, MMM NECK - supple, no meningismus CV - NSR RESP - intubated ABD - soft, NT, ND NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION (off propofol x4min) MS - does not wake to voice or deep nox, no spontaneous eye opening or other movements CN - R pupil is 2mm and NR, L pupil is ovoid (8x5mm, non-surgical per wife) and NR; weak corneals B/L; vestibulo-ocular reflex is not intact; cough SENSORIMOTOR - no movement to nox in BUEs; RLE w weak triple flexion to nox (R great toe extension); LLE w L toe flexion to nox, some weak wiggling of other toes REFLEXES - 2s in BUEs, 2s at patella, 1 at ankles B/L, toes are mute bilaterally <PERTINENT RESULTS> ___ CT Head 1.

Went to bed 9: 30 after about five beers. He typically drinks a little less, but was happy to finish his large set of orders for graduation ___ shirts (his home business). Atypically, he woke spontaneously at 3 AM. He felt wide awake, and therefore exrecised for a while before returning to sleep, then waking at 7 AM - late for him. He felt in his usual state of health. He ate breakfast and had coffee - he was planning to make a trip to shop and get supplies for his ___ work. He was getting ready to go out at about 9: 30 AM. He remembers going into the bathroom to clean his teeth. He remembers finishing cleaning his teeth. His wife was in an adjacent room. She heard a series of bangs - the noises of other things falling - perhaps three sounds. His wife was sitting at her desk and walked around the corner to look and saw him on the floor in the hall. He had hit the chest and items had fallen off of this. Her impression was that he had collided with this while falling. He was 'dramatically convulsing' on the floor, arms and legs were moving. He had bruises and an injury to his external mouth with blood - she thinks that the blood was clearly coming from the external injury that must have been sustained with his fall. His body was over the carpeted floor and his head was over the non-carpeted floor. She called ___ while continuing to walk him convulse. The ambulance came in a few minutes - she cannot be more accurate. She thinks that she was on the phone for a minute with 911. They told her to roll him on to his left side. His eyes were open, but it was as if he wasn't there. Convulsive movements were waning and gone by the time EMS arrived. EMS was at his side 9: 52, estimating during of seizure at ___ mins.

Proverbial Understanding: Abstract","Mr. ___ is a ___ year old right handed man with a single generalized convulsive seizure without aura. Two episodes of confusion in the past are poorly described and not clearly seizure. His neurological is normal. MR head is unrevealing. Routine EEG was planned as an inpatient, however the patient feels strongly that he wants to leave the hospital. We encouraged him to stay for routine EEG as it is most sensitive when performed within 24 hours, but he decided against this. We do not think he needs to be treated with a seizure medication at this moment, but should have a routine EEG; maintain adequate sleep; and cut back on alcohol to no more than 2 drinks / day to minimize risk. The patient reports that he and his wife have been discussing that he should cut down on alcohol intake. He was instructed on MA driving law and knows he cannot drive for 6 months. He no longer flies, so this is not an issue. General seizure precautions were also advised. He was instructed to call for follow up in neurology clinic after discharge as well as the EEG outpatient office for outpatient scheduling. Additionally, given his CXR showed 2 small nonspecific nodulules, it should be either repeated or compared to previous exams. This will be communicated to his PCP."

Plan: # Syncope - Mr. ___ was monitored on tele with no events. His vital signs were orthostatic and this was felt to be the most likely cause of his syncope. Per his report, he was going to great effort to take good PO with fluids at home. He continued to take good PO and he was given IVF resuscitation with almost no improvement. He was polyuric but his urine lytes did not suggest DI. He was started on florinef 0.1mg qday on ___ after failing improvement with fluid resuscitation alone, and his florinef was then titrated up. His cortisol level did not suggest adrenal insufficiency and his TSH was WNL. Cardiology was consulted, who suggested ___ of Hearts monitor, which he was given upon discharge. An ECHO was obtained, which showed mild global decreased contractility of the LV with mildly depressed EF. Cardiology felt this could be due to recent stress/illness and did not initiate CHF management. He has follow-up with Dr. ___ cardiology. He should have a repeat ECHO as an outpatient. Leading theory for now is that recent illness may have left his vessels temporarily vasodilated. Alternatively, it was considered that he may have some autonomic dysfunction from chemotherapy. He may benefit from further titration of his florinef. . # Polyuria: likely from polydipsia given urine lytes inconsistent with DI. Other possibility includes prostate symptoms, although history not particularly consistent with prostate problems. Prostate exam shows mildly enlarged though symmetric prostate. No PSA in past. PSA WNL during this admission. I doubt that his slight enlargement was causing his polyuria, which was probably from increased PO.

There is a","Acute sickle pain crisis: Pt with sickle cell disease and recent decrease in Hgb F associated with multiple pain crises over the last few months who was admitted with leukocytosis, diffuse pain and anemia. She was treated empirically with aggressive IVF, O2 and morphine PCA with mild improvement. Hematology was consulted for recurrent pain crises over the last 4mths and pt was transfused slowly for a total of 3units prbcs and goal hct of 20. She was treated with Folic Acid 3mg and initiated Hydroxyurea 1000mg daily to help decrease risk of further crisis. Pain control improved and pt was transitioned to NSAIDs alone for pain control. She was discharged on Hydrea to follow up with hematology and to monitor her CBC q 2 weeks. . Fevers/Leukocytosis due to UTI, complicated: Pt developped fever on hospital day 2 and initial blood/urine Cx were unrevealing. CXR was read as possible RUL infiltrate and pt was treated empirically with Cefriaxone/Azithromycin. However, these Abx were stopped due to the absence of any respiratory symptoms. CXR findings thought most likely due to vascular congestion in setting of sickle crisis. Pt then developped tender subcutaneous nodules over upper and lower extremities suggestive of erythema nodosum. Both Rheum and Dermatology were consulted given her history of small vessel vasculitis. Echo was ordered given concern for possible blood stream infection and known valvular abnormalities. This showed no vegetations. Etiology on nodules remains unclear and pt refused biopsy due to poor healing from prior biopsy site. Urine culture returned  for enterococcus resistant to ampicillin and fever curve resolved after starting Vanc for UTI.

Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics. Postoperative course was remarkable for the following: On postoperative day 1, the patient was complaining of very poor pain control. His medications were adjusted accordingly. The patient discussed this with the ___ and eventually admitted to illegally using drugs up until the present admission. As a result, his medications were not continually adjusted upwards. Overnight on POD1 the patient was noted to be having intermitted fevers with a Tmax of 102.1. He refused any acetaminophen secondary to his history of hepatitis C. A fever workup was initiated, and UA and CXR were negative for acute infectious process. Blood cultures x 2 were also sent and were pending at the time of discharge.

Immediately prior to discharge the patient was noted to have a heart rate in the 140's. Despite this, he was fully dressed and proceeding to leave the unit. His heart rate was discussed with him and it was recommended that he delay discharge so that a thoughtful workup of his tachycardia could be performed, however the patient refused any further intervention and proceeded to leave against medical advice. He expressed awareness and understanding of the risks of leaving the hospital with such profound tachycardia (including MI, PE, other potentially lethal conditions) and he demonstrated full capacity to make this decision, so he was not prevented from leaving the premises. Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral pain medications. The patient received Lovenox daily for DVT prophylaxis starting on the morning of POD#1.

Why am I taking warfarin You are taking warfarin because you have a medical condition that puts you at risk for forming dangerous blood clots, or to keep open vessels that have stents and or vessels that allow blood to flow for ischemic leg symptoms. How do I take warfarin Warfarin is taken once daily at the same time every day, preferably in the evening, with or without food. If you miss ___ dose of warfarin, take the missed dose as soon as possible on the same day. If you forget, do not double up the next day Write the day of your missed dose on your calendar and let your health care provider know at your next visit. Why is warfarin use monitored so carefully Warfarin is a medication that requires careful and frequent monitoring to make sure that you are being adequately treated, but not over- or under-treated. If you have too much warfarin in your body, you may be at risk for bleeding. If you have too little warfarin in your body, you may be at risk for forming dangerous blood clots. Medications, food and alcohol can also interfere with warfarin, making close monitoring even more important. What is INR INR, which stands for International Normalized Ratio, is a blood test that helps determine the right warfarin dose for you. The INR tells us how much warfarin is in your bloodstream and is a measure of how fast your blood clots. A high INR means you are more likely to bleed (your blood does not clot very fast). A low INR means you are more likely to form a clot (your blood clots very fast). All patients will have an INR goal depending on their medical condition(s), yours is ___. What are the possible side effects of warfarin The major side effect of warfarin is bleeding (especially when your INR is too high). Here are some symptoms of bleeding to look for and to report to your health care provider: ___ bruising or bruises that won't heal Bleeding from your nose or gums Unusual color of urine or stool (including dark brown urine, or red or black/tarry stools) What do I need to know about drug interactions with warfarin Many drugs can potentially interfere with warfarin and may cause your INR to change, putting you at risk for bleeding or a clot. These drugs include prescription medications, over-the-counter medications (like aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen), and dietary and herbal supplements. They should be avoided unless otherwise directed by health provider. You should take your Aspirin as directed. What role does my diet play The amount of vitamin K in your diet may affect your response to warfarin. Certain foods (like green, leafy vegetables) have high amounts of vitamin K and can decrease your INR. You do not have to avoid foods high in vitamin K,","pt pre-op'd had Myxoma resection, septal myonectomy. transfered to ___ cvicu weaned from pressure support / extubate AV conduction postop (w/ AV conduction delay) with A pacing via epicardial wire (no underlying sinus; juntional escape at ___.

Of note, she was recently admitted ___ with nausea and vomiting a day after initiating chemotherapy with paclitaxel. She was treated for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting with ofran and IV fluids. She was discharged on ___ after having improved and no longer needing symptomatic therapy. On ___, patient called in the to the oncology office to report worsening severe chest pain over her right chest. Pain was worse with breathing and worse with turning/twisting her torso. She was referred in to the ED for further evaluation. Vital signs in the ED were stable, and she was on 4L NC. TroponinT was less than 0.01, D-dimer was 898, lactate 1.6, CBC and chemistries were WNL. from H and P: A CT-A was done that showed no PE but revealed a sternal fracture with small retrosternal hematoma as well as multiple compression deformities and a small right pleural effusion. The ACS service was consulted, with no intervention recommended. The patient received 4 mg IV morphine, and 1 mg IV dilaudid for pain control. Though she was started on a heparin gtt when D-dimer returned elevated, this was discontinued upon negative CT-A of the chest. Upon arrival to the floor, the patient endorses the above story. Her pain is currently poorly controlled and worse with deep inspiration. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> from H and P: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Her breast cancer history began in ___ when she developed a left breast cancer. This was managed at ___ where she underwent lumpectomy with two excisions and an axillary node dissection. She had 19 negative nodes. After successful reexcision, she had breast conserving radiation administered at ___. She had no adjuvant systemic therapy. In ___, a mammogram showed right breast microcalcifications which were stable. These were in the retroareolar area. On the left side, however, she had an asymmetry. This was superior and posterior aspect of the breast and an ultrasound was performed showing an ill-defined hypoechoic mass measuring about 1 cm. She had a core biopsy of this area in ___. Pathology revealed malignancy, so she underwent a left mastectomy, having had a prior excision and radiation therapy on the left side. Final surgical pathology showed invasive lobular cancer measuring 13 mm. This was histologic grade II. There was a single focus of invasion. There was no lymphovascular invasion. Both hormone receptors were positive while HER-2/neu was negative by immunohistochemistry. No lymph nodes were sampled given the prior lower axillary dissection. Her Oncotype recurrence score was 20. This corresponds to a 13% ___ risk of recurrence assuming ___ years of tamoxifen. We would expect somewhat better results for management of lobular carcinoma with an aromatase inhibitor. On the other hand, this was apparently recurrent disease after prior radiation therapy, which might have diminished tumor sensitivity to additional therapy. We discussed adjuvant treatment, both endocrine therapy and chemo-endocrine therapy. She favored endocrine therapy alone strongly and I felt this was an acceptable choice. Accordingly, anastrozole was started in ___. She recently presented to the ED on ___ with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. This was felt to be related to her gastroparesis. Her CT abdomen/pelvis returned consistent with numerous hepatic and osseous metastases. In the hospital, she underwent a liver biopsy which revealed a carcinoma compatible with a breast primary tumor. Estrogen receptor was positive. HER-2/neu was not assessed.

Given the unknown etiology of his thrombus, an echo was ordered. However, given that it was the weekend, it was not performed while the patient was in house. He was therefore given instructions to follow-up with his PCP to ensure he gets appropriately worked up. His PCP was called (Dr. ___ ___  ___) and a message was left. Additionally, a cholesterol panel was checked and his total cholesterol and triglycerides were noted to be elevated. He was therefore started on simvastatin. Although our preference was to keep the patient until after his echo was performed, the patient was impatient to go home. It was therefore decided to discharge him with the understanding that he should get an echo done soon. The vascular team will try to reach his PCP again ___ morning ___ to set this up."

EGD was performed and showed clean based linear ulcer in the duonedum that was no longer actively bleeding. He had no risk factors for bleeding -- minimal alcohol use, no recent NSAIDs -- so the lesion is highly suspicious for H pylori infection. Biopsies were taken and will be followed up by GI, who plans to call the patient with the results. He will need to remain on pantoprazole 40mg BID for 6 weeks. He will follow up with his new PCP and should have symptoms and CBC assessed at that time.

He hurt his back ___ years ago, flare up in ___ another flare up, and in ___ another flare up. Since that last episode, he was left with his leg pain. Walking more than 100 feet is difficult. It goes to his posterior leg into his ankle. Occasional tingling outside of his foot. It is ___ ___nd ___ with activity. His intake form was reviewed. He has no significant past medical history. No previous procedures. He has taken and acetaminophen with codeine. No known drug allergies. He is an ___. He is married. He is ___ feet 6, 194 pounds. MRI from ___ was reviewed from ___, which shows on my read developmental congenital stenosis with short pedicles. He has multilevel spondylosis with disc degeneration primarily at L4-5 and L5-S1. At L4-5, he has a broad-based central left paracentral disc protrusion with facet arthropathy causing mild-to-moderate central stenosis. At L5-S1, there is a broad-based disc herniation centrally into the right subarticular region with slight inferior migration, which displaces the right S1 nerve root. Of note, it does not appear that the L4-5 level is consistent with his symptoms as he has isolated S1 radicular symptoms on the right side and therefore the symptomatic level is most likely L5-S1. On physical examination, this is a healthy-appearing male. Affect is within normal limits. Gait is within normal limits. He is able walk on his toes and heels without difficulty except he is unable to do a single heel raise on the right side currently. He has a positive straight leg raise approximately 40 degrees. Negative contralateral straight leg raise. No pain with internal rotation of hips. Reflexes are symmetric in the upper and lower extremities and hyporeflexic. No clonus. Sensation is subjectively decreased in the outside of his foot compared to the contralateral side. No atrophy. Distal pulses intact. This is a young patient with congenital stenosis with findings at L4-5, but symptomatic findings at L5-S1 with a central right paracentral disc herniation. The risks and benefits of conservative versus surgical management were discussed. Given his subjective weakness as well as persistent symptoms, he wished to proceed with surgical intervention. It would be microdiscectomy right L5-S1 with the goal to decrease his pain and possibly increase his strength. The risks of not doing surgery are persistent symptoms and weakness. Other options are physical therapy and injections. Risks include all those associated with surgery, but specific to this procedure, spinal fluid leak, recurrent disc herniation, and persistent symptoms, in particular weakness as well as numbness and tingling. I think the other risk factor for him is he has congenital stenosis. This is unlikely to be the last operation on his spine that he receives, particularly his L4-L5 level is destined at some point to have surgical procedure. However, at this time, I would like to minimize the amount of surgery that he undergoes and outpatient microdiscectomy I think is warranted at this symptomatic level. All questions were answered. He is given a surgical packet, and I asked him to visit our animations. I am happy to see him back before surgery if he has further questions or clarifications or his symptoms change. His family member was here with him as well and all questions were answered. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> see HPI <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> see HPI <PHYSICAL EXAM> see HPI <PERTINENT RESULTS> see HPI <DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS> You have undergone the following operation: Minimally Invasive Microdiscectomy Immediately after the operation: Activity: You should not lift anything greater than 10 lbs for 2 weeks.

He tolerated the procedure well, had a chest tube, epidural, and foley placed in the OR, was extubated, and was transferred to the PACU in stable condition. His post-op CXR was remarkable for a small left apical pneumothorax with chest tube to water seal and he was subsequently transferred to the inpatient surgical floor. He remained stable overnight into POD 1, and on POD 1 he experienced some leakeage of pink tinged straw colored fluid around his chest tube. On POD 1 his creatinine was noted to be elevated at 1.7, and his metformin was subsequently held. He continued to have adequate urine output and remained stable on POD 1 with chest tube to water seal continuing to have high output of pink fluid. Early in AM on POD 2, pt was noted to be agitated and delirious. He was placed on CIWA scale, a UA/UCx was obtained (UA indicating possible UTI), BCx were obtained, an ECG was obtained which showed no ischemic changes, and cardiac enzymes were drawn. Pt was subsequently started on empiric Bactrim for a suspected UTI and placed on IVF with supplemental thiamine, folate, and given a PO multivitamin. He recovered from delirium, and his chest tube, foley catheter, and epidural catheter were all removed on POD 2. His post pull CXR showed improved lung ventilation with no apparent PTX. His troponins trended downward and a repeat ECG showed no acute ischemic changes. He remained stable into POD 3, and his UCx showed no growth and pt was afebrile, Bactrim discontinued. On POD4 the patient was discharged home tolerating a regular oral diet, pain well controlled on oral pain medications, ambulating with assistance, and voiding without difficulty. All of his questions were answered."

The patient's family provided the bulk of the history. They report that her health has been generally well. At baseline, she is dependent on her family to help with showering, paying bills, taking her medications, etc. She used to get more services, but now she lives with family who has taken over the bulk of the physical support that she requires. She is able to safely walk with a walker, and uses a chair-elevator to get up to the main floor of her home. She has not had any fevers, diarrhea, vomitting, dysuria or any other symptoms recently. This afternoon, she had her breakfast downstairs in her room (which is unusual) and then took her medications that were scheduled to be taken. At approximately noon, she was with her husband who noticed that she acutely became unresponsive and slumped over to the right. There were no convulsive movements. They tried to wake her up by calling her name. One of the daughters thought that she had passed. She vomitted once and then slowly came to wake up over the course of the next ___ minutes or so. Following this, apparently one son noted right facial droopiness. EMS was called, and apparently, she appeared pale and not herself. She was brought to an OSH. There, NIHSS was calculated to be 7 (2 right arm, 2 right leg, 1 ataxia, 1 dysarthria, 1 aphasia) and a noncontrast head CT scan identified only atrophy. A CXR identified Progression of indolent right upper lobe airspace process, superimposed on COPD (she has known pulmonary fibrosis and is dependent on home oxygen). Routine labs including creatinine were unremarkable, and she was tx'd here for a higher level of care. By the time she arrived here, family reported that she was back to baseline. They explained that she has had this slumping episode once before, and has once previously had a frank convulsion after eating dinner at a restaurant. No concern for seizures had been previously raised. She does not take an aspirin daily, and the family could not tell why.

CUTANEOUS LUPUS LESIONS It appeared to be reasonable to assume that her worsening lesions were the ongoing result of cutaneous lupus, but given her history of healthcare exposures we were especially worried about the possibility of MRSA superinfection. We were also concerned about the possbility of progression to systemic involvement of her lupus, which given her cardiac history seemed likely. A skin biopsy showed the following results: 1. Skin, right palm (A): Lichenoid interface dermatitis with sawtooth epidermal hyperplasia, hypergranulosis, and thickening of the basement membrane zone (PAS stain) - see note. 2. Skin, right flank (B): Superficial ulcer with scale-crust suggesting excoriation, with adjacent focal vacuolar interface change - see note. Note: No vasculitis is seen in either specimen (multiple levels examined). The right flank biopsy is dominated by an ulcer, however there is an area of vacuolar interface dermatitis in adjacent intact skin. Overall the picture is compatible with lichen planus-lupus erythematosus overlap, if supported by the clinical features. . Vancomycin was started on arrival but was discontinued on ___ after it appeared that there was no infectious process. We appreciated the consult services of dermatology and rheumatology who both followed this patient while hospitalized. Dermatology recommended topical antibiotic alone for coverage of possible skin infection, which we did. We provided dilaudid for immediate pain issues and continued careful nursing care for the wound. By EKG and cardiac enzymes and history there was no clear evidence of any cardiac involvement"

Neuro","___ is a ___ with myelodysplastic syndrome who was admitted to ___ with cough and malaise unresponsive to a 5 day course of levofloxacin and with palpitations and new murmur. Chest CT was negative for acute infection as etiology of cough and echocardiogram showed increased pulmonary hypertension, suggesting that cough was secondary to pulmonary hypertension. Patient no longer had palpitations while in the hospital. EKG did show some sinus bradyarrhythmia and premature atrial complexes, which could be responsible for palpitations. Additionally, patient was anemic and received one unit of pRBCs. On discharge, the patient was feeling better and her remaining medical issues could be managed as an outpatient. # Cough: Differential included viral respiratory infection (eg parainfluenza), unresolved pneumonia given persistent RLL opacity on CXR, or increased L heart failure with pulmonary edema. Given lack of resolution of cough with antibiotics, we got a non-contrast chest CT to evaluate for bacterial pneumonia vs fungal infection vs pulmonary edema and respiratory viral panel to evaluate for parainfluenza. Chest CT showed no acute infectious process but did show chronic pulmonary nodules and bronchiectasis unchanged from ___. Respiratory viral panel was negative. Trans-thoracic echo then showed mild R atrial enlargement and increased TR gradient >40 mmHg, consistent with pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, the patient was ruled out for infectious etiology and her cough was likely secondary to pulmonary hypertension. Throughout the admission, she did not have respiratory distress, dyspnea, or oxygen requirement. She will likely need follow up with her cardiologist Dr. ___. # Palpitations/new murmur: The patient complained of palpitations the night before admission, which resolved during the day of admission.

Anasarca: The patients presentation likely represents end stage diabetic nephopathy with fluid retention and nephotic syndrome edema. This was confirmed by continued nephrotic range proteinuria and shrunken kidneys with medullary loss on the renal u/s. However, an acute on chronic nephrotic process could not be ruled out.

ARF: The patient was evaluated by the nephrology service who felt that her renal failure represented a natural progression of her diabetic nephropathy, unmonitored for over ___ years. There may be an acute nephrotic process on top as well but again, this would not change management as hemodialysis was initiated by R IJ tunnelled HD line during this admission. Her urine sediment non-inflammattory with no RBC casts and ___ coarse granular casts and her renal U/S was without hydronephrosis. That and a FeNa 1.8% all go against an acute pre-renal or post renal cause. Furthermore, an SPEP/UPEP were negative. Her PTH was elevated at 325, again indicating a chronic process. Hepatitis serologies were all negative. The patient was started on Phoslo and nephrocaps. Vein mapping was also done for further vascular access. The patient tolerated hemodialysis well with no complications. The patient will continue outpatient hemodialysis and will follow up with her outpatient hemodialysis nephrologist for further management. . # SOB"

Prior to transfer, EKG obtained showed sinus rhythm with borderline left axis deviation, borderline intraventricular conduction delay with TWF in the inferolateral leads (all changes new since previous EKG on record ___. CXR showed likely LLL infiltrate and increased vascular markings suggestive of CHF. CE's trended with peak troponin of 1.30, peak CK of 508 and peak MB of 37. Diagnosed with NSTEMI vs demand ischemia. Cardiology consulted and recommended medical management as patient could not be bolused with heparin given recent spinal procedure. Therefore, she could not undergo catheterization. She was started on aspirin 325mg, beta-blocker, high-dose statin. She underwent TTE on ___ which showed EF of 25% with septal and apical akinesis. After transferring to floor, she was taken off the heparin. Questionable thrombus in left ventricle was evulated and thought to be old with fibronsis over it, so patient was maintained on a full dose of aspirin. She was not started on warfarin due to her history of multiple falls. She remained afebrile thoroughout her stay. Physical therapy evaluated her. It was thought that her troponin leak is rate related and her poor EF is due to an old MI. This post-op tachyarrhythmia revealed the defect and cause her troponin to raise. She remained in sinus on the floor and was discharged in stable condition. Her PICC line was stopped and her foley was discharged. She does have a residue small apical pneumothorax which we are following with serial CXR. No intervention needed at this point but may need a repeat CXR in about a week.

The effusion was drained of 570cc of fluid on ___ given concern for tamponade (pericardial pressures of 23) and the etiology was unclear (auto-immune vs. influenza infection). She had since been improving on anti-inflammatories under the care of the rheumatology team when she had return of pericardial-like chest pain on ___. While she did have sinus tachycardia, her ECHO had no evidence of constriction or tamponade and the pulsus was <10 with a normal appearing IVC (as such no fluids were administered). She was discharged on a regimen of colchicine and indomethacin taper (25mg TID x 2w, 25mg BID x ___, and 25mg daily x2m). We felt like the description of her chest pain was consistent enough with pericarditis that other diagnoses such as PE did not need to be persued. She has rheumatology and cardiology follow up in the coming months and will have a repeat ECHO next week to be followed up by Dr. ___ in cardiology. We did note that there were some issues with medication adherence, mostly due to financial barriers, and we directed her to the Free Care through financial services."

E coli sensitive to cefepime grew at the OSH. WBC as high as 46K, downtrending. CT Abd/Pel showed new splenic lesions concerning for microabcesses versus infarcts. Also showed loculated ascites that was tapped and was transudative. She was initially treated empirically with vanc/cefepime/levofloxacin. Blood cultures, urine cultures, and ascitic fluid cultures were negative. C diff was negative. The levoflox was changed to flagyl after 4 days due to concern of intraabdominal process. Although she felt better and looked better clinically during her time in the ICU, she had persistently increased bands on her differential, up to 20%. She also continued to intermittently require small doses of levophed to maintain a MAP > 60. Lactate did not rise and good UOP was maintained during these hypotensive episodes. She was started on midodrine to keep her off of pressors. The source of her infection was never determined, but there was a high suspicion for an abdominal source. She completed a 14 day course of cefepime and flagyl. She was then started on PO Augmentin BID as supressive therapy for a presumed intraabdominal source. Unfortunately, there is a high likely hood that the patient will develop another severe infection in the near future, therefore, goals of care discussions were initiated as described below. # GI bleed: Patient had maroon stools on the day prior to discharge. She has a history of ischemic bowel. She was given 1U of PRBCs, but no other intervention was taken given her goals of care. #GOALS OF CARE: Family meeting held ___ afternoon with Primary Team, patient, Step-daughter ___ and ___ of Palliative Care.

Review of OMR and ___ hospital show that he has had multiple episodes of ___. He was recently admitted to ___ where he underwent a renal biopsy which revealed multiple pathologies (collapsing glomerulopathy, IgA nephropathy, and severe vascular sclerosis). In terms of collapsing glomerulopathy, can be associated with infections such as HIV, however his HIV ab is negative. Can also be related to anabolic steroids, which he uses. Vascular sclerosis can be secondary to HTN, however path report states that primary causes are more likely. Primary forms of vascular/endotherlial injury include pro-coagulant state, autoimmune d/o, drug-induced, paraproteinemia. This acute episode is likely related to recent dehydration and lack of TPN (as his central line was removed during OSH hospitalization due to bacteremia), as his Cr started to improve with aggressive hydration and resumption of TPN. # HTN: Patient without a diagnosis of HTN, but with BPs ranging from 130s-170s/60s-90s.

There was concern you had a serious head injury so you were transferred to ___ for evaluation by the trauma services. They imaged your head, chest, abdomen, and spine and found no injuries except bumps and bruises to your face and a broken tooth. You had a tube placed down your throat because of concerns about your poor mental status and vomiting leading to vomit going into your lungs, which can cause a life threatening pneumonia. Unfortunately, you did have some inflammation in your lungs suggesting a degree of aspiration, but as you were not having shortness of breath or needing oxygen this is fairly mild and should resolve on its own. As you had the tube removed without incident and did not seem to have any other major issues your are being discharged to complete your recovery. You have not been started on any medications during this hospitalization. WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU STOP USING ALCOHOL. You have multiple life threatening hospital admissions related to drinking. We strongly encourage you to discuss strategies to reduce your drinking with your PCP ___ in outpatient rehab. Please return to your","___ year old male with history of alcohol abuse presents after being found down with facial trauma for trauma evaluation. 1) Found down/Facial trauma: The exact events leading to the patient being found down and having facial trauma are unknown as he does not remember them and there are no reliable witnesses to what happened. Given his extensive facial trauma when he was found and his altered mental status there was considerable concern for more extensive ___ intracranial injuries. Extensive imaging here revealed only a broken tooth and no other significant traumatic injuries. Most likely the patient simply suffered a mechanical fall while intoxicated and facial contusions. 2) Altered Mental Status: The patient was not responding purposefully when he was found and was vomiting extensively, therefore, he was intubated for airway protection and transferred to ___ sedated. Imaging revealed no intracranial bleed or skull fracture. After extubation his mental status returned to baseline suggesting that his intoxication was the primary etiology of his altered mental status. 3) Aspiration Pneumonitis: On imaging of the chest the patient was noted to have bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Given his vomiting and intubation this was thought to be most likely due to aspiration pneumonitis. He never developed fevers, O2 requirement, or severe cough so he was not treated for aspiration pneumonia. His pneumonitis should resolve without antibiotic therapy. 4)Alcohol Abuse: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and significant injuries secondary to alcohol use. This presentation occurred with injuries in the context of abusing alcohol and benzodiazepines. When asked, the patient denied any suicidal intent and specified that he only took the benzodiazepines with recreational intent. The patient met with social work twice who discussed alcohol treatment programs. It is unclear if the patient will pursue this. 5) Leukocytosis: The patient had a leukocytosis at presentation presumably due to trauma and pneumonitis. This was improving at time of discharge and there were no signs of another locus of infection. The patient initially received IV H2 blocker for GI prophylaxis"

He reports that his pain is worse than baseline and he has had many falls since he was discharged last (earlier this week). He has refused discharge to rehab facilities twice in the prior 2 weeks but never gave a reason. Now, he would like to go to a rehab facility and says that the reason is because he met with vascular surgeon, Dr. ___ told him how difficult his EVAR will be so now he wants to get stronger in preparation for the surgery. In terms of his lower extremity weakness and chronic pain, he says that there is no change in the ability to walk. He can still only take about 10 steps before he feels that his legs are going to absolutely collapse under him--this is stable from prior admission (many falls ago) and was observed by myself and physical therapy. He expresses remorse that he did not go to rehab in those admissions and that he refused to work with physical therapy. He admits that he would like more methadone but knows that I will not give him this. He does mention in passing that after the surgery he expects more pain medications since he will have a new indication. He reports that a vascular surgeon one previous admission told him he would get more pain medications after a surgery. His respiratory status is improved per patient. He does not have any cough, complaints of DOE or orthopnea, and not using oxygen. He is still smoking. His urinary incontinence is also at baseline, with intermittent incontinence and then back to normal. It is not concerning him at this time. He has not had the dobutamine stress test for pre-op work-up and claims that he did not know about it but is reminded that 4 clinicians have told him it is necessary before EVAR and that it was scheduled but he refused it on prior admission. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> -- COPD, used to use home O2, but denies current use -- Cellulitis -- Venous insufficiency -- AAA 5cm ___ -- Hepatitis C -- etoh abuse -- ivdu with cocaine and heroine -- depression -- History of cardiac catheterization showing mild diastolic dysfunction, left main 20% stenosis, hypokinetic anterior wall, left ventricular ejection fraction 50%, otherwise normal. <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> father has had anxiety, panic and depression, was hospitalized at ___ and had ECT.

He reports that the real reason he came to the emergency room last night was because his dose was decreased and the person who hand-delivers his methadone to his home did not come x1 last night. He has multiple falls per week and these probably continually exacerbate his chronic pain but he has refused ___ and rehab in prior admissions over the past 2 weeks. His neurologic exam is difficult to interpret for signs of new cord damage/compression because he has chronic lower extremity weakness/inability to ambulate and chronic urinary incontinence with high bladder volumes. Within these limitations it seems unlikely that he has had progression of his disk herniations because his motor exam is the best that it has been over the past 2 weeks and his incontinence is at baseline. Although he reports that he can't move his lower extremities at all, he does actually walk when he gets agitated but uses a wheelchair at baseline. .

She converted between atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation during her stay. A TEE showed left atrial appendage thrombus so she was discharged on apixaban and beta blocker. ACUTE ISSUES ============ # Atrial flutter # Atrial fibrillation Patient was not symptomatic but ___ found HR elevated to 140s. Found to have recurrent atrial flutter. No evidence of ischemia by EKG or troponin. She was continued on metoprolol. The patient's rhythm converted back and forth between atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation without active intervention. The patient declined pulmonary vein isolation and cavotricuspid isthmus ablation. She preferred chemical cardioversion to electrical cardioversion, given pain after electrical cardioversion in ___. She then underwent TEE which showed a 1 cm LAE thrombus, thus, she was rate controlled with metoprolol rather than starting dofetilide. She was also continued on home apixaban (which she had not been taking), with motivational interviewing to take the medication and new arthritis medications to decrease risk of GI bleeding (see below). # Arthritis: Patient was non-compliant with apixiban, as she was worried about bleeding risk with NSAIDs that she takes relatively frequently for arthritis, primarily in her knees. Alternative pain management plan was formulated in conjunction with PCP ___. Will prescribe low dose oxycodone and asked patient to take Tylenol PRN. Discharged with script for 40 pills of 5 mg oxycodone. # Chest pain: Intermittent chest pain radiating down arm, not associated with tachycardia, no EKG changes, no biomarker leak.

The differential included tumor progression vs. transient edema from recent spinal XRT vs. too rapid tapering of steroid course vs superimposed infection given UA on admission. Per radiation oncology, no additional repeat imaging was necessary at the time. The patient's steroids were increased from his taper to 4 mg q6h on admission. He continued his radiation therapy and completed the final fraction of radiation therapy on ___. He was switched to 8 mg Decadron BID for ease. Palliative care was consulted given the limited options for treatment, as the patient is not a surgical candidate per ortho at his last admission and is not a candidate for further radiation treatment. The patient was further decreased to 8 mg qAM and 4 mg qPM Decadron on ___, but developed urinary retention on ___ (see below), so steroids were increased back to 4 mg q6h.

Per his daughters, he was last seen well around 7: 45 pm when he developed abrupt onset inability to speak and stopped using his R side. He was taken to an OSH where a head CT was obtained that did not show an acute infarct. He was then transferred here for further evaluation. In the ED he was awake, not consistently following commands, aphasic, and with a R gaze deviation. He was plegic on the R arm but moving the L spontaneously. His ___ stroke scale was 12. He was taken emergently to CT and CTA. This showed a large thrombus occluding the L ICA. These findings were discussed with the family who stated that the patient was DNR/DNI and did not want to live like a vegetable, but prior to this evening, he had been independent in most ADLS. They therefore decided that they would try IA tPA in hopes that he might retain some function. The Interventional Neuroradiology was contacted but after reviewing the CT perfusion, it was felt that the area of infarction was so large that IA tPA would not increase the chance of re-perfusion. In regards to his stroke risk factors, his last HbA1c was checked in ___ and was 6.3. He was admitted earlier this week reportedly for chest pain. A discharge summary from this admission is not available yet. During his hospital course, his TSH was checked and found to be 1.8. His LDL was 46 and his HDL was 45.

ACTIVE PROBLEMS: ============================= #DIARRHEA WITH LEUKOCYTOSIS AND PANCOLITIS: Patient presented with severe nausea/vomiting in addition to diarrhea with CT e/o pancolitis. Differential included viral vs. bacterial gastroenteritis (shigella, c.diff can cause colitis), vs, inflammatory bowel disease. Reassuringly, lactate improved s/p fluids. CDIFF, NORO NEGATIVE. It seemed that the colitis was infectious, either viral or bacterial, since it improved with time and antibiotics. - GI did not want to scope. Colonoscopy too risky with current inflammation, and they would not do a flex sig with biopsy because a full colonoscopy should really be done to fully rule out IBD in the entire colon. - Treated with Cipro/Flagyl until infectious studies returned negative - CONTINUED PO omeprazole - ___ records found to be really just significant for chronic IBS, had had work up for IBD and not been positive in the past. #NAUSEA/VOMITING: RESOLVING AT DISCHARGE Unclear if related to the pancolitis found on imaging. The patient reported that she had a developing URI for the last few days, and often those same viruses can cause GI upset as well"

ACTIVE DIAGNOSES: # Aortic Stenosis: Patient had progressively worsening aortic stenosis, recent valve area on TTE ___ was 0.8, and repeat TTE this admission showed valve area 0.5. Had been medically managed thus far. Patient and family say they have never discussed with cardiologist aortic valve replacement options. Critical aortic stenosis can explain syncope as well as strain leading to NSTEMI. Syncope is poor prognostic indicator, and indication for AVR. Patient was evaluated by cardiac surgery, who felt he would be a good candidate for AVR. Patient and family have discussed with Dr. ___ into ___ study, risks vs. benefits. He will be discharged to rehab and get readmitted in a week when his transplanted kidney may tolerate more contrast to get workup and randomization into ___ study. # NSTEMI: Patient has been having stable angina symptoms for ___ years now in the setting of worsening aortic stenosis. Had an abnormal stress echo in ___ and per family, was going to go for cath at some point in the future. On day of admission, angina symptoms did not resolve with rest, and he was found to have lateral ST depressions on EKG as well as troponin elevation to 0.03. Patient had cath in ___ that showed clean coronaries. NSTEMI could be from CAD or from strain secondary to severe aortic stenosis. Was seen on last TTE ___ to have critical AS with valve area 0.8. Was plavix loaded on admission, and 3 sets of cardiac enzymes stable. Cardiac cath showed no significant coronary stenoses, but TTE showed worsening critical AS, valve area now 0.5.

Also admitted for work up of OSH incidental CT finding of 7.5 cm liver mass. . # RUE swelling: The patient's symptoms of right arm swelling, pain, paresthesias, and cyanosis are likely explained by subclavian and axillary vein thrombosis. At an outside hospital, patient was begun on heparin gtt and symptoms significantly improved within a 12 hour period. Upon presentation to ___, patient was continued on heparin gtt, and vascular surgery was consulted. Patient did not exhibit any neurovascular compromise, as pulses were strong and equal bilaterally, strength and sensation were intact. In the setting of an incidental liver mass finding on CT, the initial concern was for an occult malignancy causing a hypercoagulable state. GI was consulted. Patient underwent MRI, which showed findings consistent with focal nodular hyperplasia, a benign lesion requiring no follow-up (see below). . Upper extremity deep venous thrombosis is an unusual finding, especially in a young, otherwise healthy female. The exact etiology of clotting in this female is unclear, but there are several potential contributors. Patient reports a history of repetitive upper body weight lifting - the veins in the patient's arms may have become stenotic over time due to repetitive compression of the vasculature. Alternatively, there may have been an innate anatomical abnormality, causing obstruction of the right upper extremity veins. Her long term use of oral contraceptive may have contributed to a hypercoagulable state. A hypercoagulable study (factor V leiden, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, protein C/S deficiency, prothrombin gene mutation) may be considered as an outpatient and conducted by the patient's primary care physician. .

Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the procedure well. Patient received perioperative IV antibiotics. Postoperative course was remarkable for the following: On POD#1, the patient had soft blood pressures and was lightheaded upon standing up when getting out of bed. Her hematocrit was 23.4. A NS bolus was ordered. She triggered for orthostatic hypotension. Ms. ___ continued to be orthostatic with soft blood pressures (SBP low 90's). She was transfused 2 units of PRBCs. On POD#2, the patient's hematocrit was 24.5. Ms. ___ was asymptomatic. The patient started complaining of a persistent cough with small amount of productive sputum. Chest x-ray was performed, which was negative for infectious processes. On POD#3, Ms. ___ continued to complain of cough and worsening shortness of breath. Medicine service consult was obtained given the patient's presistent cough and shortness of breath with a negative chest x-ray. The medicine service evaluated the patient and believed this to be an acute on chronic asthma exacerbation. Additionally, the patient had a hematocrit of 22.6. Medicine felt this post-op anemia could have also been contributing to her shortness of breath. Medicine recommended starting the patient on Prednisone 40mg x 5 days. She was also to be transfused 2 more units PRBCs. These were ordered. An EKG was also ordered to rule out cardiac causes of her shortness of breath. EKG demonstrated PVCs. Troponins were ordered which were negative for acute coronary syndrome. Repeat troponins were also negative. On POD#4, Ms. ___ noted improvements in both her cough and shortness of breath. Hematocrit was acceptable at 28.0. Vital signs were stable. Repeat afternoon CBC demonstrated hematocrit at 28.6. Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral pain medications.

He was in his usual state of health when on ___ he developed acute onset splitting headache over bilateral temporoparietal regions, ___ in pain. A few minutes later he developed horizontal diplopia with room-spinning vertigo and nausea. He went to rest on his bed, with generalized weakness. He took Tylenol ___ hour into the episode with mild headache relief. There was no photo- or phonophobia and no focal weakness or change in sensation. Headache resolved after ___ hours, with diplopia and dizziness resolving over the subsequent ___ hours after the headache went away, such that he was back to his neurologic baseline by the evening. He was subsequently symptom free until day of presentation ___. While reading from his iPhone in a seated position at around 10: 30am, he developed horizontal diplopia, worse on rightward gaze, with nausea and room-spinning vertigo. Over the next hour he then developed a moderate throbbing headache over biparietal regions about ___ in severity. He laid down in bed the whole day with slow improvement in headache, now down to ___, however with persistent diplopia and vertigo, such that in discussion with his wife, he presented to the ED. He also notes being unsteady on his feet, maybe leaning more towards the left. He was admitted to the Stroke Neurology service on ___ for headache, nausea, and then left facial weakness, left arm and leg weakness and numbness, also with vertigo and horizontal diplopia. On examination he had left-sided ataxia, difficulty with tandem gait, and positive Romberg. During his admission, there was a 7mm pontine cavernoma with chronic blood products and no evidence of acute or early subacute hemorrhage. His symptoms resolved by time of discharge and recommended outpatient Neurosurgical follow-up. He was seen by Dr. ___ ___ ___ later in ___, who felt that this anterior brainstem cavernous malformation was likely asymptomatic and did not recommend any additional evaluations or interventions. He has had similar symptoms previously. In ___ he had transient horizontal diplopia while driving. The following day he noticed left facial numbness while shaving. A brain MRI in ___ in ___ showed a brainstem cavernoma. On ___ ___, he had a similar event with a bi-temporal throbbing headache, diplopia, numbness and weakness on left side, and difficulty walking. These symptoms lasted for 12 hours. He was admitted to ___. During that hospitalization he reported symptoms of depression, heavy EtOH use, spending lots of money, and recent behavioral changes. He was seen by psychiatry who diagnosed him with bipolar disorder, began Abilify, and transferred him to the inpatient psychiatric unit for 4 days. There, he felt somewhat hopeless and took a lot of Ativan. He had been recommended by neurology to have a brain MRI for evaluation of his event with diplopia and hemiparesis but this was not done. He has a history of migraines with aura since he was young. He typically gets a headache w/vomiting a couple times per year. He's had a few visual auras, described as color changes, as if looking at everything through a rainbow. This would occur around 20 minutes before his headache.

On exam, he had horizontal diplopia on primary gaze that worsened on rightward gaze, with a subtle right exotropia (resolved the next morning). He has a positive Romberg and mildly unsteady gait. He had a prior hospitalization for a similar episode. He was admitted to the hospital for stroke workup. Stroke risk factors included TSH 2.3, LDL 87, and Hemoglobin A1c 5.1. He had a CTA head/neck without large vessel occlusion and MRI head w/o contrast which was negative for stroke, revealing only his known, baseline pontine glioma. Overall the most likely etiology was basilar migraine. Cavernoma was thought to be too anterior to explain his symptoms and appeared stable. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Changed Metoprolol to low dose Propranolol (10mg BID) for blood pressure management in setting of headache syndrome (propranolol is more efficacious for migraine) - For abortive treatment, recommend Compazine and Naproxen synergistically. Instructed to limit use to no more than twice per week, and to return to the hospital should symptoms be refractory and not responsive to treatment. - Neurology follow up was not arranged here due to patient planning to move soon, however was given the clinic contact information should he need a local appointment."

Please see the operative report for full details. Her post-operative course is detailed as follows: 1. Routine postoperative care. Immediately postoperatively, her pain was controlled with an epidural and IV Tylenol. Her diet was advanced on postoperative day #1 and the epidural was removed; she was transitioned to oral pain medications with IV for breakthrough pain. On postoperative day #4, her urine output was adequate so her foley cathter was removed and she voided spontaneously. She received lovenox for venous thromboembolism prevention. 2. Ileus. On postoperative day #2, she developed an ileus. She was made NPO and continued on IV fluids and IV pain medications. She improved with expectant management and her diet was advanced on postoperative day #3. She had one additional episode of emesis so was made NPO again and expectantly managed with improvement in her symptoms. Her diet was again advanced on postoperative #4 and was advanced to regular as tolerated. At the time of discharge, she was tolerating a regular diet. 3. Hypertension. In the postoperative period she was noted to be persistently hypertensive, with blood pressures mainly in the 150-160/80-90s but as high as 180s/90s. Her preoperative blood pressure was 150/80. For this likely underlying chronic hypertension she was initially started on metoprolol; however, her blood pressure did not respond. She was switched to IV hydralazine. On postoperative day #4, she was transitioned to oral metoprolol. Her blood pressure was adequately controlled throughout the remainder of her hospitalization. A follow-up appontment was scheduled with her PCP for management of her hypertension. By post-operative day 6, she was tolerating a regular diet, voiding spontaneously, ambulating independently, and pain was controlled with oral medications. She was then discharged home in stable condition with outpatient follow-up scheduled."

Intially, the patient presented to ___ in ___ with bilateral lower extremity weakness and a 70-pound weight loss. He underwent extensive workup including a CT scan of his chest and abdomen along with a neurological workup. He underwent a biopsy of his left supraclavicular lymph node and was thought to have high-grade lymphoma, noted to have approximately 90% cell turnover. However, unfortunately the tissue sample was not enough to make a final diagnosis. The patient had been discharged to ___, from where he subsequently presented to ___ for a 2-day history of fever to 103, hypoxia, tachycardia, tachypnea. At ___, given his presentation and SIRS criteria, he was initially thought to have sepsis, especially since information regarding his malignancy was undiscovered. Blood cx grew grew coag-negative staphylococcus, felt to be a contaminant, so antibiotics were discontinued. A repeat left supraclavicular lymph node biopsy was obtained and the results of this are pending. A CT scan of his spine and brain were obtained which did not show any metastasis; an enlarged retrocrural lymph node measuring 1.8 cm was noted. An MRI was recommended for more sensitivity; however, because of limitations due to his body habitus, MRI was not obtained. An LP was attempted to obtain CSF to evaluate for lymphoma spread to the spine; however, the patient was unable to tolerate an LP because of tachycardia and therefore this was not obtained. He was subsequently transferred to ___ for intiation of oncologic treatment. Upon arrival to the FICU at ___ the patient was somnolent but arousable, answering questions appropriately but slowly, oriented to person, place, and time. He was breathing rapidly but not with labor. He did report mild abdominal discomfort but no vomiting or diarrhea. He denied fever, chest pain, and shortness of breath.

He has had a past medical history of hypotension, with multiple recordings of systolics in the 90-100 mmHg range in the medical record. He was maintained on Levophed gtt briefly and then was stabilized for the medical floor, requiring a short MICU stay. The patient initially presented with near-syncope, but he maintained baseline mental status throughout his hospitalization. Given this elevated lactate, and his elevated creatinine and his leukocytosis, there was concern for sepsis inducing hypovolemia. However, he did not appear hypovolemic on exam and orthostatic vital signs were negative; he also maintained normal urine output. The patient was initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, but these were discontinued as it was thought that infection was unlikely. His thyroid and adrenal function were noted to be normal. An infectious work-up, endocrine work-up and Cardiology evaluation were all normal. Following volume resuscitation, his blood pressure in both arms was noted to be discordant.

ACTIVE DIAGNOSES ================ # Lower extremity weakness and pain: She presented with lower extremity weakness and pain, which caused her to fall prior to presentation. This is in the setting of many evaluations in years prior for falls. She had an MRI of the spine which did not reveal evidence of cord compression. She had an elevated CK on admission that trended down, suggestive of muscle injury in the setting of a fall, as opposed to myositis. She was evaluated by the neurology team. As there was no clear organic etiology for the weakness and pain, conversion disorder or factitious disorder were considered possible. Her pain was managed with oxycodone and acetaminophen. She regained strength on motor exam throughout her hospitalization and worked with physical therapy. By the time of discharge she was able to ambulate under her own power. # Type 2 diabetes mellitus: She has a history of type 2 diabetes and had not been taking her home oral medications for the month prior to admission. She had polyuria and glucosuria upon presentation. Her blood glucose levels were in the high 200s to 300s. She had poor glycemic control in the 3 months prior to admission as evidenced by her A1C of 17.1%. We continued to hold metformin and glipizide, which she had not been taking, during her hospitalization. She was placed on a low carbohydrate diet. Insulin glargine and an insulin sliding scale were instituted during her early hospitalization. However, she did not wish to tolerate finger sticks and insulin injections, and therefore began to refuse. Underlying this appeared to be a desire to ignore the severity of her diabetes. She was able to clearly state the risks of"

Surgery was consulted and felt that the patient was again, not a surgical option. Thus, management was conservative with IVF, pain control, antiemetics and decompression with g-tube placed to suction. Patient underwent a previously scheduled, routine g-tube change while in-house without complication.

He denies pain. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Mr. ___ around early ___ noted a lump on his back. He was referred to surgery for this raised lesion on L posterior shoulder, thought to be infected sebaceous cyst. ID was attempted and clinically the impression was an organized hematoma but due to a question of malignancy the specimen was sent for pathology. Pathology returned as malignant melanoma. The patient went on to have reexcision with 1cm margins around a bluish/purplish nevus about 3 inches away which was thought to be the primary, and excision down to muscle fascia of the large nodule. The nodule on gross pathology is described as measuring at least 4cm in greatest dimension. Pathology from the suspected primary site showed regression changes but no viable melanocytic neoplasm. PET/CT showed a L axillary lymph node with SUV 44. He was referred to ___ clinic. On initial presentation he was found to have a small wound dehiscence but otherwise asymptomatic. We discussed his case in conference and found that the large in-transit nodule had a very close but well demarcated margin. We considered reexcision but given the extent of surgery necessary and possible issues with wound closure, opted against. The patient went on to have a left axillary lymph node dissection on ___ with Dr. ___. There was metastatic melanoma, 1.5cm, in 1 of 20 lymph nodes. There was extracapsular extension in the involved node. Adjuvant radiation was recommended and we referred him to ___ in ___ to complete this closer to home. After the radiation he started IV high dose interferon. He was very depressed and started Lexapro which has helped quite a bit.

The decision was made to focus on CyberKnife for the brain lesions as noted below. Palliative Care visited him. He developed worsening brain bleeding with edema and effacement of ventricle IV on ___. He was seen by neurosurgery who offered external ventricular drainage immediately, however, given his very poor prognosis from his cancer, he and his daughter (HCP) both declined invasive measures and surgery and patient and family chose to be comfort measures only. # Intracerebral hemorrhage with mild herniation - cerebellar in origin. Fall at home with headstrike leading to intra-cranial hemorrhage with known metastatic melanoma to the brain (cerebellar mass). The bleed was thought to be spontaneous versus trauma induced from fall.

He was initially admitted to the medicine service, dueing which time his pain was deemed non-cardiac in origin. As his symptoms were considered concerning for stroke, he was transferred to the Neurology Stroke Service from ___ to ___. . ___ As the time of admission, a CTA of the head and neck was performed. The imaging demonstrated right-sided focal lucencies within the centrum semiovale and corona radiata in the setting of an apparent high grade stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. A heparin drip was started with a goal PTT of 50 to 70. . A vascular surgery consult was requested to evaluate the utility and feasbility of a carotid endarterectomy. At their recommendation, carotid duplex studies were performed to evaluate the degree of carotid stenosis with an alternative modality. While the carotid duplex studies showed less than 40% stenosis bilaterally, it was thought to be a falsley low result. Accordingly, the patient underwent a right carotid endarterectomy (CEA). A CT angiogram performed thereafter revealed a widely patent right extracranial internal carotid artery. . Following the CEA, the patient developed a more pronounced dysarthria and left hemiparesis. As the symptoms did not resolve with the optimization of cerebral blood flow, the neurosurgery team was consulted for a potential intervention. The patient subsequently underwent cerebral angiography. As the anatomy was not conducive to the procedures, no stent was placed and no thrombectomy was performed. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for close monitoring. In the setting of persistent symptoms, a CT perfusion scan was subsequently performed. The study revealed global hypoperfusion of the right MCA"

There is some discrepancy in the duration of the current picture (since ___ per patient, though perhaps up to a week or so per wife), but the patient seems to note worsening of the symptoms while walking for some time and when bending forward. He denied a progression of the symptoms this morning. His examination is notable for inattention, bilateral proximal weakness with right hemiparesis, and right-sided hyperreflexia. Our team was also concerned about parkinsonian features including bradykinesia, hypomimia and postural instability. A picture of manganism, which presents with parkinsonian features, may be seen in chronic hepatic disease. His spinal imaging does not clearly support a structural myelopathy. His MRI brain did not reveal any significant acute pathology. Sinemet was not started given his hepatic dysfunction."

The neck pain started on ___ after he carried heavy bottles of water over his shoulder. On ___ at work he noticed that his neck felt stiff, which was worse on the left side near the left Trapezius muscle. He initially presented to the ___ emergency room where it was thought that he had a strained muscle and he was given a prescription for flexeril 10 mg t.i.d. as well as tylenol with codeine for pain. This did not improve his symptoms. The following morning he noticed that when he woke up he felt a tight feeling in his neck and was having trouble swallowing. He was not having frank pain when swallowing. The pain in his neck was worsening, especially with turning his head side to side. He represented to ___ where he had a CT scan of his neck which was concerning for prevertebral swelling. He received IVF and dilaudid for pain control and was transferred to this ___ for further management. On arrival to this hospital his initial vitals were T: 97.9 BP: 159/101 HR: 106 RR: 20 O2: 98% on RA. While in the ER he received 3 liters of normal saline and zosyn 4.5 grams x 2, dilaudid 1 mg IV x 2. Laboratories from the ER showed a WBC count of 12.6 (P71 L21 M5.8), ESR of 25 and CP of 68. Ua was negative. Blood and urine cultures were sent. He was limited to 20 degrees of neck rotation in either direction without pain on flexion or extension. His voice was slightly muffled. He was evaluated by the spine fellow who noticed tenderness to palpation over the left paraspinal/trapezius muscles but no abnormalities on enurologic exam. He was seen by ENT who performed a fiberoptic exam which showed a normal epiglottis, normal vocal cords, and fullness of the pharyngeal walls R > L. He underwent an MRI of the neck which showed a small low T1 signal lesions within the lingual tonsils, left greater than right, that may represent developing abscess as well as enhancement of the retropharyngeal space and extending to the prevertebral space at the level of the C3/4 level. Neither the orthopedics and ENT services felt the collection appropriate for surgical drainage. He was scheduled for an MRI of the c-spine and admitted to the medical service for further management. On arrival to the floor he had continued neck pain. He denied having a sore throat but endorsed s stiff neck. He was able to eat and drink but feels that the back of his throat tightens when he swallows. He denied dysphagia or otalgia. He had no sick contacts. He denied fevers, chills, cold symptoms, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, leg pain or swelling.

Neck Pain/Difficulty Swallowing: Patient developed neck pain, limited range of motion and dysphagia after lifting heavy bottle of water (not an unusual activity for him). He was initially seen at an outside hospital emergency room and was felt to have a muscle strain and was given flexeril and tylenol with codeine without improvement. He represented 24 hours later with worsening pain. CT scan with contrast was concerning for a retrophyarngeal fluid collection and he was transferred to this hospital for MRI scanning and ENT evaluation. On arrival he underwent MRI of the neck which demonstrated a rim-enhancing collection involving the retropharyngeal and anterior paravertebral spaces from the craniocervical junction through C2-6 which was concerning for retropharyngeal abscess. There was no evidence of involvement of adjacent bone or epidural collection. These scans were reviewed independently by the ENT and spine services who did not feel operative intervention was warranted given his non-toxic appearance on exam and morbidity of possible operative intervention. He was evaluated by the infectious disease service who recommended initial treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and zosyn). On further review of the images it was felt that the appearance would also be consistent with retropharyngeal calcific tendinitis, a condition reported in the literature manifested by neck pain, limited range of motion, odynophagia, and mildly elevated inflammatory markers which can mimic retropharyngeal abscess. On retrospective review of the CT scan he was noted to have a small calcification in the left longus ___ muscle at the level of the atlantoaxial joint which is commonly seen in calcific tendinitis secondary to calcium hydroxyapatite deposition disease. He was monitored on the floor and at no time was he febrile"

Originally, the expectations were that the patient would be discharged from PACU following her recovery. During that process, she required multiple trials of various agents for pain management, including ketamine, fentanyl, dilaudid, oxycodone, acetaminophen, gabapentin and toradol. Due to the difficulty in managing her pain, the patient was admitted to the inpatient ward and Chronic Pain was consulted. Recommendations were appreciated and incorporated in her inpatient orders. On hospital day 2 (POD 1), Mrs. ___ was in severe pain and weeping. Her pain was entirely incisional in nature and had nothing to do with her prior right lower extremity pain. Again, Chronic Pain evaluated the patient at bedside and provided further recommendations. Specifically, they recommended that the patient not have new narcotic agents added to her regimen, i.e. hydromorphone, and that her oxycodone ___ be increased to reflect her acute surgical needs. Her adjuvant non-narcotic agents were assessed and titrated as able, but much were already nearing maximum dosing. On this day, the patient was hesitant to move out of bed, aside from ambulating to the bathroom. On POD 2, ___, Mrs. ___ began to ambulate a bit more, but still stated her pain wasn't well controlled. Chronic Pain evaluated her again and felt that her current regimen was adequate and that she should not receive any further parenteral narcotic agents such as hydromorphone. Ibuprofen PRN was added to her regimen for additional synergistic effects. When this was discussed with the patient, she was angry and frustrated. At this time, it was explained that her current medication regimen was stable and would remain the same upon discharge. As she was ambulating more, she was prepared for discharge. The patient was adamant that she wanted hydromorphone upon discharge, but at the discretion of Chronic Pain, additional narcotics would not be"

Starting last night the patient said that she woke up with diarrhea and had about 10 bouts of this over the course of the night. It started out as loose diarrhea and then progressed to watery stool that persisted into the morning with ___ more bowel movements. She denies any associated nausea, vomiting, fevers or abdominal discomfort. Upon waking up to start her day she says she initially felt overall okay other than her above-mentioned diarrhea. She then started doing some housework such as washing dishes cleaning up her home and initially started to feel slightly short of breath. This shortness of breath would improve after sitting down for a moment but would recur. On one episode when she went from seated to standing she felt sudden onset unsteadiness which she described as feeling wobbly. She said that it was if she was swaying back and forth while standing. Because of this she decided to lie down for about 30 minutes. While lying down on her couch she developed some chest pressure centrally located in her chest that did not radiate to her arms or shoulders. While lying down she says she also felt lightheaded and somewhat dizzy. She says that sometimes she has similar symptoms that occur with her panic attacks but this episode lasted much longer than usual. Because her symptoms were not remitting she decided to call the ambulance to get further evaluation. She was recently at ___ last ___ for shortness of breath. She was admitted there for a week, and was treated for an asthma exacerbation with concomitant tracheal bronchialmalacia. She was started on steroids. Initially sent home on a taper of 50 mg that was set to decrease by 10 mg every 3 days. She said that she had taken her dose prior to this episode of symptoms. She was also given a 5-day course of azithromycin for this as well. She says that after going home her breathing had improved and she had a few days then some of her symptoms started to recur. She says that she was using her albuterol rescue inhaler and nebulizers at home and these were helping her symptoms. She is unsure but thinks her weight may have been increasing in the last few days.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A complete 10-point review of systems was performed and was negative unless otherwise noted in the HPI. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> #Metastatic lung adenocarcinoma Chart review showed that in ___ the patient was initially diagnosed with a 1.4 cm solid nodule in the right upper lobe and a partly spiculated 2.2 x 1.8 cm left upper lobe lung lesion in the setting of workup for basal cell carcinoma. Also there was a 1.9 x 1.1 cm left submandibular lymph node and a 1.1 x 1.0 cm left pre-jugular lymph node. In ___ he underwent CT-guided biopsy of the left upper lobe lung mass was that showed lung adenocarcinoma with TTF-1, Napsin, and CK7; CK20 was negative. Biopsy was complicated by moderate post-biopsy hemorrhage and moderate left pneumothorax requiring admission and chest tube placement. In ___ to ___ his clinical status was decompensated and required hospitalization for failure to thrive. PET/CT on ___ showed a 6.5 x 3.1 cm left facial lesion with SUV of 12.5 representing the known basal cell carcinoma; there were 2 lymph nodes along the left lateral jaw measuring up to 0.9 cm short axis with SUV up to 3.9; there were multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules including a 1.6 x 1.6 cm lesion in the left lung with SUV 8.3, a 1.3 x 1 cm nodule in the left lung with SUV of 8.1, and a 1.4 x 1.2 cm nodule with SUV of 4.0 in the right lung; there were multiple FDG-avid hilar lymph nodes with SUV of 3.5; there were no abdominal, pelvic, or bone metastases. #Advanced left face basal cell carcinoma #History of tobacco use #Possible CAD (based on ECG) #Hypertension #s/p right second, third, and partial fourth finger amputation at age ___ due to trauma <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> No family history of malignancy. <PHYSICAL EXAM> ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAM: VS: T 97.4 BP 91","___ man with past medical history of left facial basal cell carcinoma (6.5 x 3.1 cm), and recent diagnosis of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma (multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, no lesions outside the chest), admitted with significant dehydration, hypotension, ___, and hypernatremia, leading to encephalopathy, as well as severe cachexia. # Acute encephalopathy: This is most likely due to initial dehydration, pain, chronic illness. 4mm lesion seen on CT of the head could be metastasis versus small hemorrhage, but unlikely to account for mental status. Mental status seems improved, alert, but less oriented today. His mental status waxed and waned prior to ICU transfer. # Acute hypoxic respiratory failure: He required up to 6L NC on the floor and CXR showed right mid-lower lung opacity. Given his history of dysphagia, there was high concern for possible aspiration, even though he was afebrile with only slight leukocytosis. He was started on Unasyn 3g Q12H (renal dosing) ___ for suspected aspiration pneumonia. Ultimately he likely had another aspiration event leading to worsening respiratory failure requiring intubation. # Severe dehydration with hypotension # Acute renal failure: This was likely somewhat chronic, with prerenal component as well as possible intrarenal (acute tubular necrosis). Post-renal was less likely, with initial bladder scan was only 223 cc. Renal function was improving prior to ICU transfer. # Metastatic lung adenocarcinoma: On ___, PET-CT showed multiple pulmonary nodules consistent with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. He was seen by Thoracic Surgery and Radiation Oncology who referred him to Medical Oncology. Outpatient oncologists are Dr. ___, Dr. ___. He was planning to get chemotherapy but when arriving to clinic for his initial medical oncology appointment, and the discussion about chemotherapy, he was found to have all the issues that led to this admission.

The patient was in his usual state of health until around 1530 on ___, when he was sitting in the shade next to his cousin in his backyard and started feeling cold and had chills. Per his son's report, he yawned and then his head slumped forward and he was drooling on his right side. He had no head strike or shaking. He initially had difficulty getting words out, but asked his cousin to take him indoors. His two cousins helped him walk up the stairs to the bathroom and thought he was very weak, but not more on one side or one limb. Per the nightfloat note, a cousin noticed that the patient was drooling, confused, and he did not seem to know where he was and his memory just went. There was no facial asymmetry or speech disturbances. 911 was called and measured a fingerstick blood glucose of 204 and a blood pressure of 190/75. Initially the patient refused to go into the ambulance. The patient's wife called their son ___ who drove the patient to the ___ emergency department. A code stroke was called and his stroke scale was 1. Per the son, the patient was at his baseline during the neurologic exam in the emergency department. The son reports that the patient occasionally becomes confused when his blood pressures are elevated. A similar prior episode occurred in ___ when the patient became temporarily disoriented while sitting with the son in a car. In the emergency department, his initial vitals were: 98.4, 85, 190/75, 20, 100% on room air. - Labs were significant for creatinine 1.5 (baseline 1.2), negative urine toxicology, negative troponins x1. - Imaging: Chest x-ray: 1. Lentiform opacity projecting over the left lung base is nonspecific and may represent loculated pleural fluid. Non-contrast head CT: No acute intracranial process. Of note MRI would be more sensitive for detection of acute ischemia. 2. Retrocardiac opacity is worrisome for pneumonia. - The patient was not given medications / intravenous fluids. Admitted for syncope workup, acute kidney injury Vitals prior to transfer were: 98.0 73 164/75 20 100% room air. On arrival to floor, patient denied acute complaints. He reported that he was brought to the hospital because he was outside watching someone he hired fixing the roof, got acutely cold and was out of it after.

Given the absence of lateralizing deficits, spontaneous resolution of symptoms, a negative non-contrast head CT, and reassuring exam, there was very low clinical concern for acute ischemic stroke, despite the patient's multiple risk factors. Hypertensive emergency given his SBP>180 in the setting of medication non-adherence may have manifested as altered mental status and acute kidney injury. Alternatively, his acute kidney injury, hyperglycemia, and hypertension all could have contributed to some transient encephalopathy. The neurology team evaluated the patient and did not feel that an cerebrovascular event or transient ischemic attack was likely. We gradually lowered his blood pressure with hydralazine and labetalol. His blood pressure was well-controlled with systolics in the 140s to 160s on discharge. # Hypertensive urgency vs emergency: His blood pressure of 190/75, altered mental status, and acute kidney injury were concerning for hypertensive emergency if his confusion and new acute kidney injury were secondary to his hypertension. We treated him with hydralazine, which was discontinued prior to discharge. We continued his home amlodipine 10mg daily and started him on labetalol 100mg twice a day before discharge. We stopped his home hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg twice a day once due to his acute kidney injury and poor oral intake. # Acute kidney injury: His creatinine rose to 1.6 in the ED from a baseline of 1.2. His urine electrolytes were not concerning for dehydration. We gave him fluids ad after his creatinine normalized, he was discharged home"

Underwent LP in ER with findings of meningitis. LP showed lymphocytic predominence and patient clinically looked very well so likely aseptic meningitis. However, there was concern that this could also represent early bacterial meningitis, thus he was covered empirically with Abx. Pt had a h/o severe allergy (S-J syndrome) to either cefexime/bactrim so after discussion with ID, we covered for bacterial meningitis with vanc, doxy PO, chloramphenicol IV q6. No evidence of encephalitis so less likely HSV so acyclovir not started (and we did not check for this). The ER sent off lyme serologies in CSF fluid and this is PENDING at time of discharge (communicated to PCP). Our suspicion for this was low.

Patient developed septic shock and required 3 pressors. She also developed respiratory failure and was intubated and ventilated. She was covered broadly with antibiotics. She underwent ultrasound guided cholecystoscopy and catheter placement, however her lactate continued to increase and the patient continued to clinically decompensate. Her family was made aware, and decided to pursue DNR code status with comfort measures only. Patient was taken off pressors and antibiotics and was extubated. She expired the follwing morning. Active Issues: #Septic Shock: Patient was hypotensive requiring 3 pressors, tachycardic, and febrile with leukocytosis. Source is most likely acute cholecystitis. Patient underwent ultrasound guided cholecystostomy with catheter placement, as she was not stable enough to undergo cholecystectomy. Despite intervention and broad spectrum antibiotic coverage with meropenem and zosyn, patient's lactate continued to trend up to a peak of 15 and she continued to be tachycardic, hypotensive, and acidotic despite optimizing ventilator settings. In light of clinical decompensation, the family decided to make the patient DNR, with comfort measures only. Therefore she was extubated and pressors and antibiotics were stopped. She was made comfortable with morphine drip until she expired. #Respiratory failure: Likely secondary to fluid overload or flash pulmonary edema which is supported by bilateral pleural effusions seen on CT and crackles on exam. PE was ruled out with CTA. Patient's oxygenation was maintained on the ventilator, but she continued to be acidotic despite maximizing her settings. She was subsequenty extubated for comfort per the family's wishes. #Metabolic acidosis: Secondary to lactic acidosis in setting of sepsis. Patient could not compensate respiratory wise initially and was subsequently intubated. Acidosis could not be corrected despite optimizing vent settings and patient was subsequently extubated per family's wishes as mentioned above. #Coagulopathy: INR 1.5. No signs"

The L2 vertebral body is slightly anteriorly wedged. There is no encroachment on the spinal canal. No intradural abnormalities are detected. The distal thoracic spinal cord and conus medullaris appeared normal. There is no evidence of cauda equina compression. There are mild degenerative changes with sclerosis, irregularity, and tiny Schmorl's nodes involving the inferior endplates of L4 and L5. There is bilateral neural foraminal narrowing at L5-S1, more severe on the left than right. Axial images from L1 through L5, reveal no evidence of canal or foraminal narrowing at these levels. CONCLUSION: Wedging of the L2 vertebral body and increased signal at L2, L4, and L5 compatible with recent trauma. Bilateral foraminal narrowing at L5-S1.

There were no intraoperative complications. His L2 compression fracture was confirmed to be acute by MRI and it was recommended by Orthopedic ___ surgery for a TLSO brace to be worn when out of bed. He was fitted for the brace and evaluated by Physical therapy. Because he was non weight bearing on both lower extremities he was taught how to do slide board transfer to wheelchair and became independent with this. His pain was managed effectively with Percocet and he was also started on a bowel regimen. There was concern for risk for thrombus given his orthopedic injuries and discussions took place with patient for placement of an IVC filter. He underwent an IVC gram which revealed a wide IVC; Interventional Radiology was consulted for filter placement. It was determined that the type of filter that could be used given the size of the IVC was not the retrievable type and so the decision was made to use Lovenox for prophylaxis.

He was admitted with a large left lower extremity nonhealing ulcer. We obtained venous and arterial studies. The arterial studies suggested fem-pop occlusive disease and tibial disease, and the wound appeared grossly infected. The patient was placed on IV antibiotics and underwent excisional debridement of the left leg ulcer down to and including fascia involving a 100 sq cm area. The patient tolerated the procedure well and without complications. The next day the patient underwent a left lower extremity diagnostic angiogram. It was found that the patient had patent bilateral iliac systems with evidence of a previously placed IVC filter, and a patent left common femoral artery, profunda, and SFA. The angiogram also showed popliteal artery occlusion behind the knee with reconstitution of the posterior tibial artery in the mid leg and which continues patent into the foot. The anterior tibial artery also reconstitutes via collaterals proximally, however, occludes again at the level of the ankle. The peroneal artery was occluded and not visualized.

ACUTE ISSUES: ============== # Acute-on-chronic abdominal pain: The patient presented with acute worsening of her chronic abdominal pain. Her pain was diffuse, worse in the RLQ and LLQ, with some radiation to the left flank. She had a normal UA (though pretreated with one dose of cipro). There was no evidence of an intraabdominal process on CT, and no evidence of infection of her G-J tube site. Her pain was was likely attributable to chronic gastroparesis, GERD, and multiple abdominal surgeries. Pain may have been exacerbated by straining in the past few weeks since her SPT was removed. She was treated with tylenol and her home pantoprazole, with home odansetron and lorazepam for nausea. # Aspiration pneumonia: The patient presented with no increased cough, sputum production, or worsening of her chronic dyspnea. However, a RLL infiltrate was noted on abdominal CT. In the setting of chronic vomiting, gastroparesis, and likely esophageal dysmotility, this infiltrate most likely represented an aspiration pneumonia. CAP is also a possibility. In the absence of any evidence of intraabdominal or GU infection, this infiltrate represented the most likely source for the patient's initial fever and leukocytosis. Accordingly, the patient's antibiotics were switched from vanc/unasyn to levofloxacin, to complete a 5 day course (day ___. She was afebrile throughout her hospital stay. # Anaphylactoid reaction: The patient underwent CT scan with PO and IV iodine contrast. She was premedicated for IV contrast given known dye allergy following our emergency protocol: Solumedrol Q4H standing at least 2 doses until contrast given, and Diphenhydramine 50mg IV once 1 hour before"

She started having intermittent vaginal bleeding, dysuria, urinary frequency and urgency earlier this year. CT of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast on ___, for flank pain showed nonspecific bilateral perinephric inflammation. She was diagnosed with pyelonephritis and admitted and treated with antibiotics. Followup CT of the abdomen and pelvis on ___, revealed decreased bilateral perinephric stranding. Her intermittent vaginal bleeding continued and she was seen by her primary care provider and eventually ___ urologist who noted a growth at the vaginal cuff on exam. Vaginal Pap on ___, showed HSIL, positive for high-risk HPV. Exam on ___, revealed a 3-4 cm firm, friable nodular mass at the vaginal cuff. Biopsies of the vagina and cuff showed moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Pelvic MRI on ___, demonstrated a 2.9 x 4.7 x 3.8 cm soft tissue mass arising from the superior left vaginal cuff extending into the mid vagina. The mass abutted the sigmoid colon with loss of the normal fat plane, suspicious for disease extension. The mass also abutted the posterior bladder wall with loss of the fat plane and subtle T2 and hyperintense signal enhancement within the muscularis propria consistent with disease extension. The mass abutted the left levator ani muscle without definitive disease extension. She was referred to Dr. ___ of ___ Oncology on ___, and refused an exam at that appointment. However, based on imaging, an exenterative surgery would be required to completely resect her disease. Therefore, she was referred to Dr. ___ of ___ Oncology at ___ on ___, and underwent CT simulation that same day, with a plan to receive external beam radiation therapy to the pelvis to 45 Gy with concurrent chemotherapy. PET-CT on ___, revealed an avid 6 x 4.5 cm pelvic mass at the vaginal cuff contacting the left levator ani muscle and resulting in new mild left hydroureteronephrosis. There was a new avid peripheral airspace density in the right lower lobe, and no evidence of distant metastases or lymphadenopathy. When we saw her on ___, we discussed interstitial brachytherapy following completion of her external radiation. She now returns in follow-up. INTERVAL HISTORY: Since we saw Ms. ___, she received pelvic radiation to 45 Gy from ___ to ___ with concurrent weekly cisplatin. She was seen by urology and as her hydronephrosis was mild and kidney function was normal, no stent was needed for the left ureter. Her radiology was also reviewed at the tumor board at ___, and the right lower lobe lesion was not concerning for metastasis, and therefore there was no need for a biopsy. She had an MRI earlier today at ___, results are pending. Physically, she is experiencing 10 loose stools/diarrhea per day over the last 2 days, and has stopped her stool softener and miralax as of 4 days ago.

He presented from outside hospital with ongoing fevers. Patient not treated with antibiotics at OSH despite ongoing fevers. Patient on arrival only had low-grade temperature with T-max of 99. His lack of leukocytosis was reassuring against infection. Full infectious work-up was done which was all negative. Patient had no ascites on imaging and bedside ultrasound. His recent bacteremia with new pleural effusion was concerning. Interventional pulmonology was consulted who felt that the pleural effusion was too small to safely be tapped. And given the ultrasound appearance, it was unlikely to be the focus of infection. Patient remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable throughout the admission. Patient's pleural effusion was ultimately felt to be due to hepatic hydrothorax. #ETOH/HCV Cirrhosis (MELD 19, CP C), decompensated #Hepatic encephalopathy #HCC #Listed for Transplant Initial presentation with confusion was likely due to hepatic encephalopathy likely from not taking his medications complicated by a higher predisposition to worsening encephalopathy given recent"

The entire office assessment and plan has been dictated under a separate letter by the ___ nurse ___. In summary, however, ___ is a ___ female who presents with syndrome consistent with metastatic breast carcinoma. She was initially diagnosed in ___ with T2, N3, M0, double hormone receptor positive and HER-2/neu amplified infiltrating ductal carcinoma, according to ___ recording of her medical records. She has undergone wide excision with positive lymph nodes treated with chemotherapy and secondary total mastectomy in the past. Recently imaging shows progression of a previously identified L3 vertebral lesion, encompassing more than 50% of vertebral body, raising concern for increased likelihood of pathologic fracture and consideration of prophylactic management recognized by the evaluating radiologist. For that reason, she presents today for evaluation and consideration of surgical treatment. Today we reviewed the remainder of her history, physical exam, prior imaging studies, and new imaging studies. Her past medical history, surgical history, medications, allergies, social history, family history, and review of systems are included in the intake sheet as part of the medical record. I reviewed this with the patient for accuracy. Imaging: I reviewed the MRI of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine as well as the radiologist's report, dictated by Dr. ___. This demonstrated a 3.7 x 3.3 cm vertebral body mass within the L3 vertebrae. This is compatible with metastatic focus. It also demonstrates mild left paravertebral soft tissue infiltration. There is also abnormal signal in the superior anterior corner of L4, concerning for metastatic disease as well. There are no cervical or thoracic metastases observed on the MRI study, however. There are multiple pulmonary metastases, denoting a known history of metastatic disease as well, better observed on the ___, CT of torso. I also reviewed the CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis performed on ___, I also reviewed the radiologist's report of that study dictated by Dr. ___ and Dr. ___. This demonstrated an increased size of lytic component of the L3 vertebral body lesion. Given that it encompasses over 50% of vertebral body cross section, the radiologist's recognize that likelihood of pathologic fracture has increased and consideration of prophylactic management be advised. Impression and Plan: ___ is a ___ female with a lytic lesion within the L3 vertebral body, progressive despite ongoing treatments, not causing risk for fracture. I discussed with her at length the alternatives, risks and benefits of both surgical and ongoing nonsurgical care in the setting of metastatic disease with pending instability. I explained to her that surgical treatment can be helpful, by providing fusion across the lesion, in preserving the stability of her spine, and also preserving her neurological function, which currently is excellent. We discussed the technical details of the operation as well as the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the operation. I did make an ink drawing for her today to help explain the technical details which would be a posterior instrumented spinal fusion. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> 1) right breast CA 2) s/p gastric bypass 3) hysterectomy 4) longstanding essential HTN 5) radiation induced cardiomyopathy <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> mother with MI at ___ <PHYSICAL EXAM> see HPI <PERTINENT RESULTS> ___ 05: 45PM SODIUM-137 POTASSIUM-5.1 CHLORIDE-105 ___ 11: 30AM GLUCOSE-189* UREA N-13 CREAT-1.0 SODIUM-138 POTASSIUM-6.2* CHLORIDE-108 TOTAL CO2-20* ANION GAP-16 ___ 11: 30AM estGFR-Using this ___ 11: 30AM PLT COUNT-414 <MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION> lisinopril 40 mg Tablet 1 Tablet(s) by mouth ___ carvedilol (Prescribed by Other Provider; Dose adjustment - no new Rx) 25 mg Tablet 1 Tablet(s) by mouth twice a day lapatinib [Tykerb] 250 mg Tablet 5 Tablet(s) by mouth daily Take on an empty stomach.

On appearance on the Emergency Department, the patient continued to be hypotensive in the ___ and ___, though mentating well. He initially refused any central line, but was willing to accept peripheral pressors, so he was started on norepinephrine. When that was maximized and his blood pressure had still not much recovered, discussion was initiated and he accepted the placement of a right IJ, at which point a second pressor, phenylephrine, was added. He continued to require both pressors in order to achieve an adequate blood pressure. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> - End-stage renal disease ___ diabetic nephropathy s/p cadaveric renal transplant ___, - Coronary Artery Disease, s/p Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction, CABG, Multiple PTCA/stents, last being bare metal stent to SVG-OM2 graft ___. - Congestive heart failure -EF 20% on TTE ___ - Chronic afib on Coumadin - Hyperparathyroidism - Diabetes-type II - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - Gout - HSV meningitis in ___ - Spinal stenosis - Sciatica chronic back pain and left hip pain - s/p AV fistula for HD - Scalp seborrhea Past Surgical History: - cadaveric renal transplant ___ - CABG - AV fistula for HD <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> Father died of MI in early ___, brother died of MI age ___.

The patient's hypotension is of unclear etiology, but was supected to be secondary to sepsis. He had not been febrile or had a white count. He has a recent intervention to his right foot that may be a possible site of infection, although his wounds currently do not have obvious visual evidence of infection. His urinalysis has small leuks and few bacteria (but no pyuria). CXR and CT abdomen not suggestive of specific He has been on longstanding prednisone. SVO2 not suggestive of cardiogenic shock. Due to a CVP of around 30, no additional fluids were provided. The patient was started on broad-spectrum coverage with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and aztreonam. (The patient once had an anaphylactic reaction to penicillins.) He was also placed on stress-dose steroids. Vascular Surgery was consulted, but intervention would likely have been a below-the-knee amputation. On ___ in the early afternoon, the patient's pressor requirement suddenly increased. He then developed a wide complex bradyarrhythmia with poor perfusion and mottling of his appendages. In keeping with his wishes against aggressive resuscitation, the patient's family was informed of his grave prognosis. No additional pressor was added, and the patient expired in the early afternoon of ___, likely secondary to a cardiac event caused by the strain of his likely sepsis."

He has not been seeking care in the outpatient setting, reliably attending HD, or taking medications. Social work, physical therapy and occupational therapy were consulted who recommended that the patient be discharged to a facility for further rehabilitation. The patient's pain from his fall was treated with APAP and oxycodone as needed. # Altered mental status Throughout admission, he had episodes of altered mental status, felt to be multifactorial related to medication effect, delirium, electrolyte and blood sugar derangements. He also endorsed intermittent visual hallucinations that appears to be chronic (generally occurring during hospitalization, likely related to delirium). Trazodone was discontinued. Hypoglycemia was treated as below. There was low suspicion for acute neurologic process as his neuro exam remained consistently nonfocal throughout. He will follow up with cognitive neurology as an outpatient. # Volume overload # BNP>70K # Electrolyte abnormalities # ESRD on HD ___ On presentation, the patient was found to have hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and evidence of volume overload with bilateral pleural effusions and lower extremity edema. Notably, he had not attended HD for several sessions prior to admission. The patient underwent HD sessions as per his usual home schedule with ultrafiltration to offload fluid.

Upon admission, an abdominal ultrasound was done, which showed a non-distended gallbladder without evidence of acute inflammation. You were kept on bowel rest and maintained on IV fluids in the interim. You were seen by the gastroenterologist. They recommended that you get an upper endoscopy. This was done, which appeared normal. Biopsies were taken. A HIDA study (gallbladder scan) was re-done which came back negative for any","This is a ___ year old female, who was sent to ___ by her gastroenterologist secondary to a positive HIDA that was done. She has a PMH significant for anxiety and left ureteral damage during cystoscopy. She has had one year of abdominal pain worse in the last three months with unclear etiology, and was being worked up as an outpatient. It was decided that she be admitted for further workup of her abdominal pain. Abdominal U/S upon admission showed a non-distended gallbladder with no evidence of acute cholecystitis. She was made NPO and maintained on IVF, although she was allowed to eat dinner on HD1. Gastroenterology was consulted to see if they could provide further insight into the cause of the patient's abdominal pain. They recommended an EGD to rule out PUD. This was done on HD2 and results showed normal mucosa. Urology was also consulted. They believe that her abdominal pain is not urologic in nature due to her extensive urologic workup in ___. There was a question whether the outpatient HIDA was done correctly. Thus on HD3 the patient was sent for a repeat HIDA. This came back as a normal study. Therefore, a discussion was had about the utility of an exploratory laparotomy. This was deferred to the outpatient setting, as the patient was hemodynamically stable with normal labs and vital signs. She was tolerating a regular diet, though she did still continue to endorse RUQ pain. During this hospitalization, the patient ambulated early and frequently, was adherent with respiratory toilet and incentive spirometry, and actively participated in the plan of care. The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay. At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well controlled. The patient was discharged home without services. The patient received discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding verbalized and agreement with the discharge"
